I implemented gender recognition with SVM using the sigmoid kernel	
The file face_to_matrix.py is not needed. I used that file only to resize,
convert the images to matrices and finally to save those matrices onto 
a binary filed called faces.npy. Believe me, that file will make your life 
so much easier since I already grouped training, testing, and the labels
and added randomness to the data. You only have to load the faces.npy and 
separate the grouped data as I did in my program.
